## Status: ⏳ BLOCKED

**No implementation exists yet.** Project is in spec/planning phase only. The following handoffs are delivered:
- ✅ Product spec
- ✅ API contract
- ✅ Frontend implementation plan
- ✅ Designer deliverables (component spec, visual direction)
- ❌ No source code, no `package.json`, no runnable app

## Next Steps

1. Wait for frontend scaffold (Phase 1 of implementation plan)
2. Execute TC-8 (API contract) as soon as BFF endpoints are available
3. Execute TC-6 (security) as soon as first client bundle is built
4. Full test run after Phase 3 (office panel + SSE) is delivered
