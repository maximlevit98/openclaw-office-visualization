# Producer Approval — Office Visualization Concepts

**Review Date:** Saturday, February 21st, 2026 — 2:06 AM (Europe/Moscow)  
**Cycle:** 3 (Autonomous Producer Review)

## Concept Evaluations

### ✅ Concept A: "The Bullpen" — **GO**

**Status:** APPROVED for Phase 0/1 development

**Rationale:**
- Best alignment with brief: agents framed as "office teammates" deserve a spatial office metaphor
- MVP approach is pragmatic: flat avatar cards with expressive status badges now; isometric layer as post-MVP enhancement
- Instant status scanning + memorable interaction model ("walk up to their desk")
- Differentiates product without over-engineering Phase 0
- Producer directive met: **personality + utility + implementable MVP**

**Gating:** Proceed with Phase 1 core data flow using this direction.

---

### ❌ Concept B: "Mission Control" — **NO-GO**

**Status:** REJECTED for MVP; hold as future alternative

**Rationale:**
- Violates brief: "The Bullpen" explicitly frames individual agents as coworkers, not a control room
- Data-dense sparklines and status rows better suit multi-operator at scale; out of scope for single tailnet user
- Warm, approachable tone requirement not met (dark, cold aesthetic)
- Viable fallback only if product scope expands beyond MVP or user feedback shifts toward ops-center priorities

**Decision:** Archive for Phase 4+ backlog review.

### ❌ Concept C: "The Loft" — **NO-GO**

**Status:** REJECTED for MVP; too casual for operator tool

**Rationale:**
- Visually appealing but risks undercommunicating urgency and errors (toy-like at scale, poor error clarity)
- Doesn't meet operator expectations: emoji mood indicators are fun, not informative
- Better suited as a fun dashboard for casual team use, not a single-operator production tool
- Personality cost not justified when Concept A delivers both warmth and utility

**Decision:** Archive for potential community/secondary dashboards.

## Summary

**Keep 3 concepts?** Yes, all three remain documented for future reference and user feedback pivots.

**Proceed with:** Concept A — "The Bullpen"

**Next Steps:**
1. Frontend Engineer proceeds with app scaffold using warm palette tokens (Concept A aesthetic)
2. Designer refines agent card component design with desk nameplate feel
3. Phase 1 tasks locked to this direction

**Risk:** None. All roles have clear deliverables and consensus on direction.

**Producer Sign-Off:** APPROVED  
**Phase Gate:** Phase 0/1 exit criteria unchanged. Ready for Phase 1 kickoff.
